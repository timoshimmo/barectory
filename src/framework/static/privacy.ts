      We can however accept a cancellation for your order at the point of purchase. This is also expressed by our shopping cart which allows you to remove items and adjust your resultant cost at your discretion.${"<br/>"}
      We also entertain the cancellation of orders before the items are shipped to you. This will attract the delivery cost associated with that sale. We will thus refund the amount charged, less the delivery cost in this instance.
